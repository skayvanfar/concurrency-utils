 * custom thread pool that uses before-Execute, afterExecute, and
 * terminated to add logging and statistics gathering. To measure a task's runtime, beforeExecute must record the start 
 * time and store it somewhere afterExecute can find it. Because execution hooks are called in the thread that executes 
 * the task, a value  placed  in a ThreadLocal by beforeExecute can be  retrieved by afterExecute. TimingThreadPool 
 * uses a pair of AtomicLongs to keep track of the total number of tasks processed and the total processing time, and uses 
 * the terminated hook to print a log message showing the average task time.
